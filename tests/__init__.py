# Required file for pytest to recoginize this test folder

# To create a test file, it needs to be prefixed with 'test_'. For example,
# if you wanted to test the student module, you'd name the file
# 'test_students.py'.
#
# Test names themselves also need to be prefiexed with 'test_' for pytest to
# pick it up. So writing a function that tests addition, do:
# def test_addition(): instead of def addition():
